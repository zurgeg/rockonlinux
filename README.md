# RockOnLinux
RockOnLinux is a set of fixes, scripts, and patches for music creation related software

## File structure
### Status (top level)
Here you will find a few folders
- `working`
- `untested`
- `broken`

These are mostly self explainatory.

### Maintaince (second level)
Each of these is under a status folder (`working`, `untested`, or `broken`).

There are a couple folders here:
- `active`
- `semiactive`
- `semidead`
- `dead`

These represent how often we maintain the content within. `active` is usually kept up-to-date with the latest software versions and is actively updated. `semiactive` might be out-of-date, but is still somewhat actively updated. `semidead` is likely out-of-date, but may get poked every once in a while. Finally, `dead` is an archive of things that we don't work on anymore.

### Source (third level)

Contained under the `official` folders, you can find software officially supported by RockOnLinux software and how to use it. It will almost always be verified to work.

Things under the `community` folder may work, and may be updated by RockOnLinux, but is not guarenteed to work. These things may get moved to the `official` folders once we test them.

## Current project status (last updated 12th of October, 2023)
